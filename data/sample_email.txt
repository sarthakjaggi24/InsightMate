Subject: Weekly Project Status - AI-Based Chatbot Development

Dear Team,

As of this week, the development of our AI-based chatbot is progressing as scheduled. The frontend integration is complete, and the backend API is currently under testing. We've achieved 70% of our sprint goals, and are on track for the planned demo next Friday.

Pending tasks include:
- Final LLM integration
- Security audit
- Deployment pipeline automation

Team members are expected to update their individual task progress in the dashboard by Thursday EOD.

Best regards,
Sarthak Jaggi
